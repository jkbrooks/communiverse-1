Since the specific code for `search_agent` is not provided, I will assume a simple scenario where `search_agent` is a class with some methods. The class will be defined in `SearchAgent.py` and then imported in `main.py`.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `SearchAgent` class in `SearchAgent.py`: This class represents the search agent. It may have methods like `search` and `get_results` to perform a search and retrieve the results, respectively.

2. `main` function in `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of `SearchAgent` and uses it to perform a search.

Now, let's write the code for these files.

SearchAgent.py
