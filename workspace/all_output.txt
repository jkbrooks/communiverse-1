Since the specific code for `search_agent` is not provided, I will assume a simple scenario where `search_agent` is a class with some methods. The class will be defined in `SearchAgent.py` and then imported in `main.py`.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `SearchAgent` class in `SearchAgent.py`: This class represents the search agent. It may have methods like `search` and `get_results` to perform a search and retrieve the results, respectively.

2. `main` function in `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of `SearchAgent` and uses it to perform a search.

Now, let's write the code for these files.

SearchAgent.py
```python
# This class represents a search agent
class SearchAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the search agent
        pass

    def search(self, query):
        # Perform a search based on the given query
        pass

    def get_results(self):
        # Retrieve the results of the last search
        pass
```

main.py
```python
# Import the SearchAgent class from SearchAgent.py
from SearchAgent import SearchAgent

def main():
    # Create an instance of SearchAgent
    search_agent = SearchAgent()

    # Use the search agent to perform a search
    search_agent.search("example query")

    # Get the results of the search
    results = search_agent.get_results()

    # Do something with the results
    print(results)

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace the `pass` statements in `SearchAgent.py` with the actual implementation of the search agent. The `main.py` file should work as is, provided that the `SearchAgent` class is correctly implemented.
