Please update the code so that `search_agent` is loaded from another file in the repo.  All code used to generate `search_agent` should be written in another file and main.py should import this file use its contents to initialize `search_agent`.  We want to set the stage for creating other such agents that are imported from other files and may be modified independently of this file.
