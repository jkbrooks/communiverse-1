The class will be defined in `SearchAgent.py` and then imported in `main.py`.\n\nHere are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:\n\n1. `SearchAgent` class in `SearchAgent.py`: This class represents the search agent. It may have methods like `search` and `get_results` to perform a search and retrieve the results, respectively.\n\n2. `main` function in `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of `SearchAgent` and uses it to perform a search.\n\nNow, let's write the code for these files.\n\nSearchAgent.py\n```python\n# This class represents a search agent\nclass SearchAgent:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize the search agent\n        pass\n\n    def search(self, query):\n        # Perform a search based on the given query\n        pass\n\n    def get_results(self):\n        # Retrieve the results of the last search\n        pass\n```\n\nmain.py\n```python\n# Import the SearchAgent class from SearchAgent.py\nfrom SearchAgent import SearchAgent\n\ndef main():\n    # Create an instance of SearchAgent\n    search_agent = SearchAgent()\n\n    # Use the search agent to perform a search\n    search_agent.search(\"example query\")\n\n    # Get the results of the search\n    results = search_agent.get_results()\n\n    # Do something with the results\n    print(results)\n\n# Call the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nPlease replace the `pass` statements in `SearchAgent.py` with the actual implementation of the search agent. The `main.py` file should work as is, provided that the `SearchAgent` class is correctly implemented."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To install dependencies, you can use pip, a package installer for Python.
